# Pullover
*The unofficial multi-platform Pushover desktop client.*

My fork with support for diplaying Pushover Messages on a LG TV with WebOS and speaking the messages trough TTS, the TTS support only works on OS X, WebOS support works on all platforms.

In this file on line 143: https://github.com/spambus/Pullover/blob/master/src/js/app.js

You need to change the ip address to the ip address of your LG TV in your lan/wifi network.

## Why was this App created?

I discovered Pushover in mid November 2014 and was really excited. The only thing missing was a decent desktop client. At the time there was only a rudimentary Notification Center integration for Mac. But I was missing the following features:

* Show the icon of the notifying app (it always showed the pushover icon)
* Make the notification clickable to open URLs attached to notifications
* Support for Windows or Linux

## Installation / Download

Goto [Pushover.net](https://pushover.net/licensing) and get a desktop license (there is a trial period if you want to try it out first). **Without this license Pullover will not work.**

## Build your own
You can create builds for all platforms with Mac OS, take a look at [CROSSPLATFORM.md](CROSSPLATFORM.md) to find out about necessary dependencies.

1. Install build dependencies: `npm install`
2. Install dependencies of Pullover: `cd src && npm install`
3. Rename `config/buildConf.json.sample` to `config/buildConf.json`
4. Open `config/buildConf.json` and adapt `platforms:` to your preference
5. Return to root dir and build binaries with: `./builder build`
6. If the build process was successful, you can find the binaries in `bin/pullover/[platform]`
7. If you want to package them (`.zip`/`.dmg`/`.exe`), execute `./builder createDist`
8. The distributables will be placed in `bin/deploy`

### Development

There is no need to always build packaged binaries if you want to dive into the source of Pullover and try out some changes. Instead install the node dependencies in the root folder and in source with `npm install` and run the `builder` script. Make sure to copy `config/buildConf.json.sample` to `config/buildConf.json` first

    cp `config/buildConf.json.sample` `config/buildConf.json`
    npm install
    cd src && npm install
    cd ..
    ./builder run

### Bugs

If you encounter a bug or Pullover crashes, please go to the following directory and send me the `pullover.1.log` file by opening an issue:

* OS X - '/Users/user/Library/Application Support/pullover'

## Contributing

If you miss a feature or fixed a bug, don't hesitate to create a pull-request. I open-sourced this App with the hope that others contribute to it. Especially for Windows and Linux since I rarely use those systems.

## Planned features

I am currently rewriting Pullover and a list of planned features is in the [wiki](https://github.com/cgrossde/Pullover/wiki). If you have any feature wishes not listed there then open an issue and I will take a look at it.
